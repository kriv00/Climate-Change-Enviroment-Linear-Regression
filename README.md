# Climate-Change-Enviroment-Linear-Regression
I explored a data set on climate change or the environment that has both continuous data (numbers) and discrete (categorical). Using linear regression, build 5 models.

## Steps:
1. Declare the problem you are solving with your models.
2. Identify the data set and where you got your data, describe its variables, and why it is a good data set for your problem.
3. Embed a correlation plot (corrplot) of your data, but only limit it to the variables you will use in your analysis. This means remove columns you will not be using.
4. Create randomized training and testing sets from your data set.
5. Build each model with only the training set but evaluate each model with the testing set. List the independent and dependent variables for each model and its resulting root mean squared error (continuous models) and accuracy (discrete models) for each model.
6. Describe which continuous model is best and why, then describe which discrete model is best and why.
